    <p>
        My name is Kafayah Omobolanle Lawal, I am originally from Lagos Nigeria.
        I have lived in the United States for over 7 years(since August 2013). In my free time, I like to take walks at sunset,
        read books, listen to podcasts, take nature pictures and enage in great conversations with friends and family.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm passionate about learning and improving the standard and quality of my life.
        I am working hard to make an ambition off of my passion. I hope to do my best in whichever organization
        I become a member of to achieve the highest level of success and productivity.
        I am dedicated, consistent and hardworking. I believe in always putting my best foot forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        After graduating Cum laude from the University of Houston and garnering skills from the professional world,
        I realized what field would best serve my career aspirations and embarked on the journey to get a
        Masters degree in Management Information Systems at the University of Nebraska.
        This new field and qualification is giving me the needed exposure and enlightenment to help turn my dreams to reality.
        <br>
        My positive outlook on life and other values like patience, consistency, reliability, volunteerism, honesty and
        accountability make me a wonderful colleague. My collaborative, creative and strategic strengths make me a
        great addition to any team.

        <br>
        <br>
        My goal is to secure a position in an organization whose values align with mine, where I can pursue my passion and
        fuel my ambition while actively and positively making an impact on the world.
